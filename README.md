# Disease-prediction

Each prediction page is conneceted with a Machine Learning Model which uses Random Forest Classifier to predict the results.
Also we have 2 different datasets used for each prediction.
We can land into each prediction site of the web app from the options in the Navigation Menu.
Each prediction is done with the help of 4 features which will be taken as input from the user.
The most relevant features are taken into consideration for prediction also these features can be found out with simple tests or analysis without visiting any doctor.
So the victim can get a broad overview of their health condition.
